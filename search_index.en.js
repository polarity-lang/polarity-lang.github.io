Lang"},"https://polarity-lang.github.io/docs/":{"body":"This page contains the reference documentation of the language features and information about how to use the command line interface.\nLanguage Reference\nData Types\nThe simplest form of data types do not have parameters or indices. In that case, the constructors of the data type can be given as a comma-separated list. As with all syntactic constructs, we always allow trailing commas.\n\nIn the more general case we have to specify the precise type that a constructor constructs. Therefore, the above data type declaration can be written more explicitly as:\n\nA simple example of a parameterized type is the type of singly-linked lists of some type a. In that case, we have to specify both the parameters of the type constructor List, and the instantiations of the term constructors Nil and Cons. For the parameter of the type constructor List we make use of the impredicative type universe, which is written Type.\n\nA proper dependent type is the type of length-indexed lists: the vector type. The VNil and VCons constructors of vectors create vectors with different indices.\n\nFinally, we can define the Martin-Löf equality type as follows:\n\nCodata Types\nCodata types are specified by a list of methods or destructors. A very simple example is the type of pairs of a boolean and a natural number:\n\nThis type supports two observations; the first observation proj1 yields a boolean value when invoked on a Pair, and the observation proj2 yields a natural number.\nA common codata type that is typically built into many programming languages is the function type. In our language, it is not built-in, but we can define it as follows:\n\nCodata types can also model infinite types. The type of infinite streams is a classical example and written like this:\n\nSometimes we also need to reference the object on which a method is invoked in its return type. This is especially the case when we want an observation to yield a proof that the object satisfies some property. Here is a simple example which shows how this can be expressed:\n\nDefinitions\nDefinitions create a consumer (method) for a data type. These consumers receive an implicit input on which they pattern match. As a simple example, we can define Boolean negation as follows:\n\nDefinitions can be recursive. For instance, we can define addition on natural numbers as follows:\n\nDefinitions can also deal with parametrized types. For instance, we can define a map method for the data type List as follows:\n\nFinally, to illustrate dependently typed definitions, let us give the classic example of defining append on length-indexed lists:\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the return type of a definition may not only depend on its parameters but also on its (implicit) input. To do so, we can make the input explicit by assigning it a name. For instance, we can prove that Boolean negation is its own inverse as follows:\n\nCodefinitions\nCodefinitions create producers (or objects) for codata types. They need to define the behavior of the object when each of its destructors is invoked. Analogously to pattern matching, where we pattern match on the constructors of a data type, we copattern match on the destructors of a codata type. For example, we can create a pair with the Pair codata type defined above as follows:\n\nWe can retrieve the values in the pair by invoking one of the destructors. For instance, MyPair.proj2 will yield the result of 42.\nCodefinitions can also be used to construct infinite objects. For instance, we can generate an infinite stream that counts upwards as follows:\n\nFinally, codefinitions can also return proofs that they fulfill certain properties:\n\n\nToplevel Let Bindings\nExpressions can be defined at the toplevel using let bindings.\nIn the following example we bind the expression S(S(S(S(Z)))) to the name four:\n\nThese top level bindings are opaque by default.\nThis means that they are not unfolded during type-checking and not judgementally equal to their body.\nThis behaviour can be controlled using the opaque and transparent attributes.\n\nMarking toplevel let bindings as transparent should be done with caution, since recursive let bindings can lead to non-termination during normalization and type-checking.\nThe Main Expression\nA toplevel let binding named main which does not take arguments is treated specially.\nThis binding is evaluated by pol run and printed to the console.\nLocal Let Bindings\nLocal let bindings can be used to make expressions more readable or to factor out common subexpressions.\nIn the following example we use a local let binding to bind the term S(S(Z)) to the variable two.\n\nLocal let bindings can also be annotated with a type.\nThe same example then looks as follows:\n\nInfix Declarations\nInfix operators can be declared and used for type constructors and constructors.\nFunctions, for example, are much more readable when we can write a -&gt; b instead of Fun(a,b).\n\nComments\nLine comments are written using two forward slashes: // This is a comment. Certain items of the program can also be annotated with a documentation comment. Here is an example using doc-comments:\n\nThese documentation comments are preserved during defunctionalization and refunctionalization.\nNotes\nSome parts of the documentation of a module describe high-level design choices or principles and do not correspond to a single declaration.\nFor this use case we support notes: toplevel declarations with a name to which we can attach textual documentation.\n\nNotes are preserved during program transformations and are part of the browsable documentation generated by the pol doc subcommand.\nTyped Holes\nAn incomplete program can be written using typed holes. Typed holes are written using either ?; they have type ? which unifies with any other type. For example, an incomplete implementation of boolean negation can be written as follows:\n\nAttributes\nAn attribute is a freeform metadatum that can be added to various pieces of syntax.\nThese attributes can then be interpreted by the compiler or other tools.\nAttributes are written in a similar style as Rust and C#: We use #[attr1,attr2] in front of an entity that we want to annotate.\n\nThe following attributes are currently supported by the compiler:\n\nomit_print Toplevel declarations annotated with this attribute are ignored by the prettyprinter.\nThis is useful for codesnippets that are compiled to tex in order to be included in documents.\nopaque and transparent These attributes can be used on toplevel let bindings to control whether the binding should be inlined during normalization.\n\nCLI Reference\nIn order to learn more about available options you can use pol --help on the command line.\nThis section contains more information about specific subcommands.\nSubcommand texify\nIf you want to include a color-highlighted polarity snippet in a tex file then you can use the pol texify subcommand which generates typeset latex.\nThe generated tex code will depend on some custom color definitions.\nWe suggest that you include the following definitions in the preamble as a starting point.\n\n","id":"https://polarity-lang.github.io/docs/","title":"Docs"},"https://polarity-lang.github.io/faq/":{"body":"What is the core idea?\nThe core idea of polarity is that a modern functional language should have equal support for data and codata types.\nWe want to show that this is a practical idea by developing a language which does not have any types which are hard-wired into the compiler.\nIn particular, the types of functions and dependent functions are defined by the user as custom codata types.\nIs it production ready?\nNo. Polarity is part of a research project which studies the feasability of programming with dependent data and codata types.\nAs a normal part of a research project we will frequently make breaking changes in order to explore new ideas.\nIs polarity a proof assistant?\nNo, the language cannot be used as a proof assistant since it is not consistent.\nPolarity is Turing-complete, which means that you can write non-terminating programs and that every type is inhabitated by some term.\nInstead, polarity is a dependently-typed programming language similar to a project like dependent Haskell.\nWhat does the logo depict?\nThe logo is inspired by an arctic hare which has a white winter coat and a dark summer coat.

OOPSLA '24 Published Version, Extended Version with Additional Appendices\nThe expression problem describes how most types can easily be extended with new ways to produce the type or new ways to consume the type, but not both. When abstract syntax trees are defined as an algebraic data type, for example, they can easily be extended with new consumers, such as print or eval, but adding a new constructor requires the modification of all existing pattern matches. The expression problem is one way to elucidate the difference between functional or data-oriented programs (easily extendable by new consumers) and object-oriented programs (easily extendable by new producers). This difference between programs which are extensible by new producers or new consumers also exists for dependently typed programming, but with one core difference: Dependently-typed programming almost exclusively follows the functional programming model and not the object-oriented model, which leaves an interesting space in the programming language landscape unexplored. In this paper, we explore the field of dependently-typed object-oriented programming by deriving it from first principles using the principle of duality. That is, we do not extend an existing object-oriented formalism with dependent types in an ad-hoc fashion, but instead start from a familiar data-oriented language and derive its dual fragment by the systematic use of defunctionalization and refunctionalization. Our central contribution is a dependently typed calculus which contains two dual language fragments. We provide type- and semantics-preserving transformations between these two language fragments: defunctionalization and refunctionalization. We have implemented this language and these transformations and use this implementation to explain the various ways in which constructions in dependently typed programming can be explained as special instances of the general phenomenon of duality.\n\n\n","id":"https://polarity-lang.github.io/publications/","title":"Publications"}},"docInfo":{"https://polarity-lang.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://polarity-lang.github.io/docs/":{"body":626,"title":1},"https://polarity-lang.github.io/faq/":{"body":114,"title":1},"https://polarity-lang.github.io/install/":{"body":207,"title":1},"https://polarity-lang.github.io/publications/":{"body":354,"title":1}},"length":5},"lang":"English"}
