# Editor Support

We offer a plugin for Visual Studio Code which provides rich editor services via the language server protocol (LSP).
The plugin is available on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=polarity-lang.polarity) and can be found by searching for `polarity` in the extensions browser of Visual Studio Code.

The plugin can also be built from source using the instructions in the GitHub repository [github.com/polarity-lang/polarity-lang-vscode](https://github.com/polarity-lang/polarity-lang-vscode).
